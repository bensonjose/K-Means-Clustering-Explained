# K-Means-Clustering-Explained

**What is K-Means clustering in Python?**

<br>
The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset. <br>There are many different types of clustering methods, but k-means is one of the oldest and most approachable.<br><br>


**Kmeans algorithm**<br>
<br>
1.We initialize k centroids randomly.<br>
2.Calculate the sum of squared deviations.<br>
3.Assign a centroid to each of the observations.<br>
4.Calculate the sum of total errors and compare it with the sum in the previous iteration.<br>
5.If the error decreases, recalculate centroids and repeat the process.<br><br>

**K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. <br>Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.**

**It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.**
